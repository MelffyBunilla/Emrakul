# Emrakul

Emrakul is a mtg card-fetcher discord bot based on [Bolas](https://github.com/theneosloth/Bolas), which itself is heavily inspired by [yawgmoth](https://github.com/Lerker3/yawgmoth).

The docstring for each one of the plugins are all concatenated together and can be displayed with the hardcoded “!help” command.
