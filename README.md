# Emrakul

Emrakul is a mtg card-fetcher discord bot based on <a href="https://github.com/theneosloth/Bolas" target="_blank">Bolas</a>, which itself is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Lerker3/yawgmoth" target="_blank">yawgmoth</a>.

The docstring for each one of the plugins are all concatenated together and can be displayed with the hardcoded “!help” command.

## Changes compared to Bolas
```
The price command now also works for DFC cards
You can use regex like on Scryfall now
You can search for DFC cards also with the full name using the two slashes like some websites do
The messages that pop up when you search something embarrassingly wrong destroy themselves in 5..., 4..., 3..., 2..., 1...
"sad robot", "bob" and "tim" now show the proper versions they reference
When the Bolas bot owner types in !obey, it says "Hi dad." and when I type it says "Hi mum."
```
